## 🏗️ Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a patient has Alzheimer’s disease based on demographic, lifestyle, and health-related features. The workflow follows standard machine learning pipeline practices including:

- 🧹 Data cleaning and inspection  
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- 🛠️ Feature encoding (OneHotEncoding) and scaling  
- ✂️ Train/Test splitting  
- ⚖️ Handling imbalanced classes using SMOTE  
- 🤖 Model training and evaluation with logistic regression and random forest  
- 🔧 Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation  

---

## 📋 Dataset

The dataset includes the following types of features:

- **Demographic**: Age, Gender, Country, Marital Status, Income Level, Urban/Rural Living 🌎  
- **Health-related**: BMI, Physical Activity Level, Smoking Status, Alcohol Consumption, Diabetes, Hypertension, Cholesterol Level, Family History of Alzheimer’s, Depression Level, Sleep Quality, Dietary Habits, Air Pollution Exposure, Genetic Risk Factor (APOE-ε4 allele), Stress Levels 💊  
- **Cognitive**: Cognitive Test Score 🧠  
- **Target**: Alzheimer’s Diagnosis (Yes/No) 🎯

Some columns like Employment Status and Social Engagement Level were removed during preprocessing due to low predictive power. ❌

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- 📈 Histograms for numeric features  
- 📊 Countplots for categorical features  
- 🌡️ Correlation heatmap for numeric features  
- 📐 Pairplots for numeric features  

All visualizations are saved in the `Visuals/` directory and logged using Python’s `logging` module. 🗂️

---

## 🛠️ Preprocessing

- ❌ Dropped irrelevant columns  
- ⚖️ Scaled numeric features using `StandardScaler`  
- 🔢 One-hot encoded categorical features using `OneHotEncoder`  
- ✂️ Separated features (X) and target (y)  

---

## ⚖️ Handling Imbalanced Data

The target variable (`Alzheimer’s Diagnosis`) is imbalanced. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) was applied to the training set to balance classes. 🧪

---

## 🤖 Modeling

Two models were used:

1. **Logistic Regression**  
   - Fitted on SMOTE-resampled training data  
   - Hyperparameter tuning performed using `GridSearchCV` with F1-score as metric  

2. **Random Forest Classifier** 🌲  
   - Fitted on SMOTE-resampled training data  
   - Hyperparameter tuning performed using `GridSearchCV`  

---

## ✅ Evaluation

- Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report for both models  
- 🔄 Cross-validation performed to check model stability  
- 🏆 Best F1-scores logged for each model  

---

## 🔮 Future Work

- 🔧 Further hyperparameter tuning for both logistic regression and random forest  
- 🌟 Test additional models such as Gradient Boosting or XGBoost  
- 📈 Evaluate using more metrics like ROC-AUC, precision-recall curves  
- 🏗️ Perform feature engineering to improve predictive performance  
- 📊 Improve EDA with more detailed statistical analysis  
- 🤖 Automate pipeline for reproducibility
